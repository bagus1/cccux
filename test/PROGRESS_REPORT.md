# CCCUX Engine Testing Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of setting up and testing the CCCUX Rails engine, which provides role-based authorization and user management functionality.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Initial Setup and Model Structure
- ✅ Confirmed that `posts` table and model should only exist in the dummy app, not the engine
- ✅ Cleaned up stray migrations from the engine
- ✅ Set up proper model relationships between User, Role, UserRole, and Ability models

### 2. Test Infrastructure Improvements
- ✅ Replaced OpenStruct-based test doubles with real models and FactoryBot factories
- ✅ Created comprehensive factories for all models:
  - `User` factory with proper attributes
  - `Role` factory with name normalization
  - `UserRole` factory with proper associations
  - `RoleAbility` factory for permission mapping
  - `Post` and `Comment` factories for testing contextual permissions
  - `PostManager` factory for ownership testing
- ✅ Fixed FactoryBot loading issues by explicitly loading factories in tests

### 3. Database and Migration Setup
- ✅ Created all necessary migrations:
  - `create_cccux_roles.rb` - Roles table
  - `create_cccux_ability_permissions.rb` - Permissions table
  - `create_cccux_role_abilities.rb` - Role-ability mappings
  - `create_user_roles.rb` - User-role associations with `active` column
- ✅ Fixed foreign key constraints and data integrity
- ✅ Added proper indexes and unique constraints

### 4. Authorization System Integration
- ✅ Integrated Devise authentication in dummy app
- ✅ Fixed `current_user` method in tests to use actual test users
- ✅ Resolved role name normalization issues (e.g., "TestAdmin" → "Test Admin")
- ✅ Fixed `active` scope issues on UserRole that was filtering out roles
- ✅ Updated authorization helpers to properly recognize permissions

### 5. Controller and Route Fixes
- ✅ Fixed CCCUX engine controllers to require "Role Manager" role
- ✅ Resolved route conflicts between dummy app and engine
- ✅ Updated engine routes to remove conflicting root route
- ✅ Fixed controller references from `Cccux::User` to `User`
- ✅ Added proper Devise test helpers and session management

### 6. Test Coverage Improvements
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Role assignment and checking
  - Permission-based authorization
  - Contextual/ownership permissions
  - User role management
  - Authorization flow testing
- ✅ Added debug output to trace role and permission application
- ✅ Fixed test setup to ensure all user roles are set to `active: true`

## Current Issues

### 1. Test Hanging Problem ⚠️
**Status**: CRITICAL - Tests are hanging during execution

**Symptoms**:
- Tests start but don't complete
- No error messages or output
- Process appears to hang indefinitely

**Potential Causes**:
- Database connection issues
- Infinite loops in authorization logic
- Deadlocks in test setup
- Memory leaks from test data

**Debugging Steps Taken**:
- Added verbose output to tests
- Checked for stuck processes
- Verified database connections
- Added debug logging to authorization system

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Add timeout mechanisms to tests
- [ ] Implement step-by-step debugging
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies in authorization logic
- [ ] Monitor system resources during test execution

### 2. Shell and Environment Issues
**Status**: RESOLVED - Terminal was restarted and processes killed

**Issues Encountered**:
- Shell commands failing
- Stuck processes
- Database preparation hanging

**Solutions Applied**:
- Restarted terminal session
- Killed stuck processes
- Reset test database
- Added proper error handling to rake tasks

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Fix Test Hanging Issue**
   - [ ] Implement test timeouts
   - [ ] Add granular debugging
   - [ ] Check for authorization logic loops
   - [ ] Verify database transaction handling

2. **Complete Test Suite**
   - [ ] Ensure all authorization scenarios are covered
   - [ ] Add edge case testing
   - [ ] Test role hierarchy functionality
   - [ ] Verify contextual permission logic

### Medium Priority
3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize database queries in authorization
   - [ ] Add caching for role/permission lookups
   - [ ] Improve test setup efficiency

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
   - [ ] Add usage examples
   - [ ] Document configuration options

### Low Priority
5. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Add role inheritance
   - [ ] Implement permission groups
   - [ ] Add audit logging
   - [ ] Create admin interface

## Test Structure

### Current Test Files
- `test/models/cccux/role_test.rb` - Role model testing
- `test/models/cccux/user_role_test.rb` - User-role associations
- `test/models/cccux/ability_test.rb` - Permission system
- `test/controllers/cccux/authorization_controller_test.rb` - Authorization flow
- `test/integration/cccux_authorization_flow_test.rb` - Integration testing

### Test Categories
1. **Model Tests**: Verify data integrity and associations
2. **Authorization Tests**: Test permission-based access control
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end authorization flow
4. **Controller Tests**: Verify proper authorization enforcement

## Configuration

### Dummy App Setup
- Devise authentication installed
- CCCUX engine mounted
- Proper routes configured
- Database migrations applied

### Test Environment
- FactoryBot factories configured
- Test database properly set up
- Debug logging enabled
- Proper test helpers included

## Key Learnings

1. **Role Name Normalization**: The Role model automatically normalizes names, which affects `has_role?` checks
2. **Active Scope**: UserRole has an `active` scope that can filter out roles unexpectedly
3. **Devise Integration**: Proper Devise setup is crucial for authorization testing
4. **Route Conflicts**: Engine and dummy app routes can conflict and need careful management
5. **Factory Loading**: Explicit factory loading is required in engine test environment

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Focus on resolving the test hanging issue
2. **Short-term**: Complete the test suite and ensure all scenarios work
3. **Medium-term**: Optimize performance and add documentation
4. **Long-term**: Add advanced features and admin interface
